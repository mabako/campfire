Inspired by Tom Critchlow's article on [Building a Digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/), there's three distinct concepts of information flows:
- Streams
- Campfires
- Gardens

While my personal notes are, for a lack of public access, not quite a digital garden, I very much would benefit from bringing my blog and my notes closer together.

The result is üèï Campfire: a tool to cut my collection of notes into smaller pieces of more worthwhile, more curated stories to share.
